1. Input is of the form :
arrival time of process 1, cpu burst size , i/o burst, cpu burst, i/o burst, ..., -1
arrival time of process 2, cpu burst size , i/o burst, cpu burst, i/o burst, ..., -1
.
.
.

2. Output should be of the form:
2.1 Process id, burst number 	start time 	end time

can repeat same Pi, burst number because when there is preemption it will complete its burst later
sample:
p1,1 0 0
p2,1 1 3
p1,1 4 7
p2,1 8 10
p3,1 11 12
p2,1 13 15

2.2 Average completion time= E [when process completed- when process came in]
2.3 maximum completion time= max (when process completed- when process came in)
2.4 Makespan = time between start of first and end of last job
Waiting time= sum of all intervals where job is waiting to be scheduled (for the time when it is in the ready queue and some other process is running on cpu).
2.5 Average waiting time.
2.6 maximum waiting time.

3. components:
3.1 cpu queue with current executing process.
3.2 ready queue 
3.3 waiting queue
3.4 time counter
